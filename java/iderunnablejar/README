This is a project that shows how to create a runnable JAR.

Instructions for IntelliJ IDEA
==============================

Step 1. Create a java project

Step 2. Create unit test for the App class:
  Position the cursor on the class for which you want to create a test.
  Right click and create the test.

  Then position on the cursor on the created import statements
  and click the light bulb to add JUnit5 to the list of libraries.

Step 3: Configjure the IDE for JAR creation
  Go to File ->  Project Structure
  Select Artifacts click the + sign and choose the JAR option.
  Then specify the main class and click Apply and then Okay.


Step 4: Generate the JAR.
  Go to Build -> Build Artifacts..
  Choose build or rebuild from the men
  Choose build or rebuild from the menu.

Instructions for Eclipse
========================

Step 0a: To Create a project with existing source.
(This is only because the IntelliJ project was created first, and I want
both IDEs to use the same source files.)

Create a New Java Project. 

Uncheck the use default workspace and specify the  path to the
project directory.

Give the project the same name as the directory in which it is going to
be created.

When prompted to create a module file, choose don't create.


Step 0b: Remove the existing jar created by IntellJ that is accidentally
added to Eclipse.

Not doing this will cause Eclipse to look for depenencies in this JAR.
This will cause the build to fail if you checkout the project on a 
machine where the IntelliJ IDEA IDE is not installed.


Choose Java Build Path

Select the testjar.jar file and click remove.

Choose Project -> Properties


Step 1: Add support for JUnit
Open the AppTest file. Position the cursor over the @Test annotation.
Use the popup to add JUnit5 library.
